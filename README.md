# zetago
A new repository for Zeta based on go-script-bash for ease of documentation and use

### Method for conversion
-------
This repo will be where we eventually fold in the following repos

- JohnOmernik/dcosprep
- JohnOmernik/maprdcos
- JohnOmernik/zetadcos
- JohnOmernik/zetapkgs

This other repos may continue to get updates until they are completely folded in to zetago. Once all of a repo's functionality is plug and play to zetago, we will make a commit that tells people the source repo will no longer be updated.
