# Functions for common use
#
# initconf - Load a conf and/or replace it. Used when the scripts assume a conf does not exist and needs to have it created
#
# sourceconf - Attempt to source a conf file, if the conf doesn't exist, exit with an error message
#
# lockconf - lock (or unlock) a give conf file
#
# checkapi - Check a given URL to determine if it's up and running. Keep trying until the number of fails is reached, then FATAL out
#
# getpass - Request a password from the User 
# --------------------------------------------
#
# function initconf
# This function is a simple tool that will look for a conf file, and if it's found and not locked, or not found, instead of exiting, will run through a conf creation process
# If the conf is found, and locked, it will simply source the conf and move on
#
#  Logic: Check if a Conf Exists
#   - If No Call the Conf Creation script
#   - If Yes then offer the user three option: Replace the conf, Use the existing conf, or examine the conf
#     - E (Examine) the conf displays the conf to the user and then provides only two options Use the conf or Replace the Conf
#     - U (Use) the conf will source the conf and move forward
#     - R Replace the conf will call the creation script and replace the conf in question with the results of the conf creation script
#
# There is one argument, the path to the conf.
